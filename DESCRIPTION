Description: Given a data matrix with rows representing data vectors and columns representing variables, produces a directed polytree for the underlying causal structure. Based on the algorithm developed in Chatterjee and Vidyasagar (2022) <arxiv:2209.07028>. The method is fully nonparametric, making no use of linearity assumptions, and especially useful when the number of variables is large.
